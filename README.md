## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Does this work with any YouTube video?**  
A: Yep! Public videos, at least. Private/restricted videos are YouTube's call.

**Q: Where are my loops saved?**  
A: In your browser's localStorage. Same device, same browser = your loops are there.

**Q: Can I share my loops with friends?**  
A: Yes! Use "Save List" to export, send the JSON file, they use "Load List" to import.

**Q: Does this work offline?**  
A: The app does, but YouTube videos need internet. We're good, but not *that* good.

**Q: Why did you make this?**  
A: Because sometimes you just need to loop something. You know the feeling.
